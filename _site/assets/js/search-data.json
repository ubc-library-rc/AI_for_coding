    "content": "The library has a detailed workshop about LLMs, so for this workshop we are not going to get very technical. The very simplified version of training a model includes two steps: . | \"the computer\" looks at a lot of data (training data) to learn the patterns that exist | \"the computer\" takes new data that it has never seen before (testing data). Then, using what it learned in step 1, \"the computer\" sees if it can predict what comes next. | . Because LLMs are always improving, “the computer” (the LLM) always goes back to step 1. Your brain is a very fancy LLM in a lot of ways. For example: . | Have you ever finished someone's sentence for them? Does this happen more often when you know the person better? | Can you tell how people are feeling? Are you much more accurate with people you know better? | . That’s right, you are predicting what is going to come next based on previous data (experience with that person). More and better data = better predictions. In addition, humans can rely on more than just “data”, “patterns”, and “predictions” to shape and adjust their behavior. We rely on context around this information to inform our actions. That's very cool! But, this should cause you to pause. You are also wrong sometimes, even with the people you know best (partners, best friends, kids,...). LLMs can be wrong too. LLMs can be wrong because the model is wrong and/or because they are missing context. This is a major concern when using LLMs, or any AI tools for that matter. ",

If you don’t know the steps to get to your end goal, ask ChatGPT to outline the steps for you. We go over this in our next workshop. The more targeted your question, the better the answer. Throughout making this workshop, ChatGPT has gotten much better at answering all parts of the question, which is cool! This might not always be true, so try asking a single question at a time if you find that the AI is not answering all questions. However, even very direct questions can get inccorect answers. In the example below, we asked a question that was not clear, then, we tested the response in the two following questions.

This means that you probably shouldn’t upload confidential or priviledged information to any LLM. We will learn how to deal with this constraint in the Dummy Data workshop. Environemental . LLMs are very resource-intensive to train and run. Between the materials used to construct the big datacentres, the electricity to keep them running, and the fresh water needed to cool them, that’s a lot of resource use!

In “AI speak”, a question/text input you ask/give the AI is called a prompt. AI can explain code to you . Paste in some code in ChatGPT and ask it to explain what the code means. Let’s try with this code: . library(tidyverse) ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=cyl, y=mpg))+ geom_point() . Note about LLM explanations . LLMs are text generators, so when you ask them to explain something, they generate text that explains the concepts you asked about. However, LLMs do not understand the output. This is a small, but important distinction. It means that if the answer seems superficial and not fully satisfactory, that’s because it is. You can ask the LLM to re-phrase or re-explain, but at some point, it might be better to go look at content written by a human. AI can write code for you . ChatGPT and other AI models are often text generators. Code is text, so it is well within their capabilities to code for you (most of the time). However, if we recall from last week, how questions are worded is very important, as it affects the quality and completeness of the answer the AI generates. In this section, we learn how to talk to the AI to get the best possible answer. Breakdown the analysis into steps: Steps to make a sandwich . Let’s ask ChatGPT how to make a sandwich. You can specify preferences, like we did (cheese!). Breakdown the analysis into steps: Steps to run an analysis of variance (ANOVA) .

    "content": "AI tools are here and people are using them. When first learning how to code, there is a lot of new vocabulary to learn (what people call parts of code and data types) along with actually generating code that will get you the desired end result. This is difficult to do for everyone, but AI tools can help with some of this. In this workshop series, we aim to 1) help people who are uncomfortable using AI tools feel equipped to try them out and 2) to help experienced AI users examine how they could use AI tools to code more efficiently.

Each workshop builds a single skill, so feel free to attend them in a series or to target particular areas where you need more assistance. Each workshop is designed to start with 15 minutes of teaching, followed by 15 minutes of questions and/or working on practice problems. ",
