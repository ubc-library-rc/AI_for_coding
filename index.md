## Why did we make this workshop? 
<p>AI tools are here and people are using them. </p>
<p>When first learning how to code, there is a lot of new vocabulary to learn along with actually generating code that will get you the desired end result. This is difficult to do for everyone, but AI tools can help with some of this.</p>
<p>In this workshop series, we aim to 1) help people who are uncomfortable using AI tools feel equipped to try them out and 2) to help experienced AI users examine how they could use AI tools more efficiently. </p>


## What do the workshops entail?
<p>In this workshop series, we will go over skills that will help you use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models" target="_blank">Large Language Models (LLM)</a> to code more efficiently. 
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> is an LLM, but others include 
  <a href="https://gemini.google.com/" target="_blank">Gemini</a> and 
  <a href="https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F" target="_blank">Claude</a>. </p>

<p>Each workshop builds a single skill, so feel free to attend them in a series or to target particular areas where you need more assistance. </p>

<p>Each workshop is designed to start with 15 minutes of teaching, followed by 15 minutes to ask questions or work on practice problems. </p>
