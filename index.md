<p>In this workshop series, we will go over skills that will help you use <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models" target="_blank">Large Language Models (LLM)</a> to code more efficiently. 
<a href="https://chatgpt.com/" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> is an LLM, but others include

  <a href="https://claude.ai/login?returnTo=%2F%3F" target="_blank">Claude</a>. </p>

<p>Each workshop builds a single skill, so feel free to attend them in a series or to target particular areas where you need more assistance. </p>
