## UBC AI rules
Professors will specify for each class or for their labs what AI usage is acceptable and that should be your main guidance, as long as it fits into the AI policies by UBC. 
UBC has a through explanation of what is and is not appropriate [here](https://genai.ubc.ca/guidance/){:target="_blank"}, but we highlight a few key points from this website below.

## Key points from the UBC GenAI website.
### Principles section
Essentially, don’t upload data to the LLM and you are responsible to ensure the output are accurate. 
### Teaching and Learning section
AI can enhance learning, but there are concerns about legalities. Similarly to the principles section, don’t upload data to the LLM. For class, UBC states “Students may use GenAI in work submitted for courses or other academic requirements only if expressly permitted within their courses or programs.”. In this section, UBC also points out that AI can be biased, give false information, and that passing off LLM output as your own is not ethical or allowed (plagiarism).
### Academic integrity section
UBC states that AI use is allowed in class, but only is explicitly allowed by the instructor. For instructors, the use of AI detection software is discouraged, as it has been shown to be inaccurate. AI detection software is so bad, that UBC has disabled the AI detection feature of Turnitin.
