Now that we have learned a few skills to interact with LLMs more effectively in the previous workshops, it is time to put it all together.
We will work through how to run a t-test in R.

## Ask for help (Breakdown workshop)
Ask the AI “what are the steps by step instructions to run a two-sample t-test in R”? Ask for sources and note down the steps.


## Upload data for ChatGPT to use (Dummy data workshop)
ChatGPT uses example data in the code, but using dummy data allows the generated code to use the variable names in your dataset, so you won't need to edit the code when copy/pasting it from the response. 
<ol type="1">
<li>Make a dummy dataset. Let’s make one with two columns:
  <ol type="i">
  <li>A continuous variable</li>
  <li>Indicating to which of the two groups the observation in column (i) belongs.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>Upload the dummy data.</li>
</ol>

## Ask for step by step help
Go through the step by step instructions we got earlier and as ChatGPT for help with each section, using your dummy data. Simultaneously, run the code yourself to see if the code ChatGPT has given you matches. This is the time to address errors that occur. 

## Sanity check
Does the output make sense with your dummy data?
